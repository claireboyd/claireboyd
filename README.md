### Hi there üëã 

My name is Claire Boyd and I am currently a data scientist with NYC's Department of Finance Property Modeling team, where we assess the value of all residential and commercial properties in the city annually. I graduated in 2024 from [UChicago's Masters in Computational Analysis and Public Policy](https://capp.uchicago.edu/) program. Before that, I was a researcher at the Urban Institute for 4 years, focusing on racial equity analysis and equitable grantmaking practices for foundations and federal funders.

Feel free to explore the following projects/coursework below to get a better sense of my skills and interests: 

* üîß [Open Source Tool Onboarding @ NYC](https://github.com/nycdepartmentoffinance/onboarding) (Ongoing): Created a series of guides that document the set-up of city machines for open source tools. These hopefully should all be useful for any city employee but they were designed for onboarding new data scientists or analysts at the property modeling team at the NYC Department of Finance (DOF)

* üìö [Interactive Data Dictionary](https://nycdepartmentoffinance.github.io/data_dictionary/) (Ongoing): Built an interactive data dictionary to make it easier for our team to explore the data we have currently available across our multiple data assets. This can be updated directly from the database metadata, and is supplemented with our own legacy documentation. Helpful when trying to locate a random field across tables or seeing if we collect a certain type of property characteristic.

* üçΩÔ∏è [Dirty Comments, Clean Plates](https://github.com/claireboyd/dirty_comments_and_clean_plates) (March 2024): Used a corpus of text-based Yelp restaurant reviews to train a model to classify if a restaurant is likely to fail a health inspection and predict if a review is human-generated or generated by OpenAI's GPT 3.5 or 4.

* ‚òéÔ∏è [311 Requests in Chicago](https://github.com/claireboyd/311requests_chicago) (December 2023): Created a simple web app which gives users a summary of the 311 requests in their Chicago neighborhood, built with Lambda Architecture principles using Apache's tech stack (HDFS, Hadoop, Hive, Spark, etc). The cluster that the app was built with is no longer active, so watch the video included to see the app in action!

* üêÄ [Predicting Neighborhood-Level Rat Activity in New York City](https://github.com/claireboyd/predicting_rats_nyc) (September 2023): Created a time series predictive model to forecast the volume of weekly rat-related 311 requests in each neighborhood, informing mitigation strategy for NYC Rat Czar.

* üè† [Finding comparable properties with LightGBM](https://github.com/claireboyd/comparable_property_finder) (June 2023): Developed a new feature, the "comparable finder," into the R package lightsnip which enables accurate identification of comparable properties crucial for assessing property values in Cook County. [Read more here](https://ccao-data.github.io/lightsnip/articles/finding-comps.html) for a longer explanation of this project.

* üìà [COVID-19 Online: How people interacted with government websites during the pandemic](https://github.com/claireboyd/covid19_online) (March 2023): Working alongside three classmates, we built a complete data pipeline (from collection to visualization) to explore web traffic to HHS websites during the pandemic.

* üìù [Publications](https://github.com/claireboyd/publications) (Aug 2018-Present): This repository has a list of my recent publications from my time as a researcher at the Urban Institute's [Office of Race and Equity Research](https://www.urban.org/policy-centers/office-race-and-equity-research).
